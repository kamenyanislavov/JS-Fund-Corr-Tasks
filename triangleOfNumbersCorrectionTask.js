// the first loop must continue until equal to 'n', otherwise it does't reach the upper end of the boundery.
// the nested loop must continue until the number of iterrations is equal to 'curNum' and not 'n'. 
// Otherwise it will print always same number of digits, which will be one less than 'n'. Another problem is that
// evey loop it will print the digit on new row. So the output is completly different.
